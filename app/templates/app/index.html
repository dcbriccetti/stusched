          <p>One of the challenges in teaching programming to kids is organizing the kids into
              groups by ability, interest, budget, and availability.
              This system is designed to help with that.</p>

          <p>It will take a bit of effort, but if you add yourself and your young programmers
              to this system and keep the information up to date, you are much more likely to
              have the courses you want very soon.</p>

          <h4>Procedure</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Register yourself as the parent or guardian of one or more students</li>
              <li>Provide information about each of your children you are seeking instruction for,
              including what courses they want and when they are available</li>
              <li>Propose courses if you don’t see what you want</li>
              <li>Form your own groups when you can</li>
              <li>Watch for suitable
                  <span title="A section is an instance of a course, at a specific time"><em>sections</em></span>
                  and enroll your children in them</li>
          </ul>
