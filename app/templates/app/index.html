          <p>One of the challenges in teaching programming to kids is organizing the kids into
              groups by ability, interest, budget, and availability.
              There are many students who would be taking classes with me now if only they
              could join with enough suitable classmates to form a class.
              I am developing this system to help with that.</p>

          <p>It will take a bit of effort, but if you add yourself and your young programmers
              to this system and keep the information up to date, you are much more likely to
              have the classes you want very soon. The approach of me guessing at what people want
              and when they want it hasn’t worked very well.</p>

          <p> With this system you can:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Register yourself as the parent or guardian of one or more students interested in learning computer
                  programming from <a href="http://davebsoft.com">me</a>
              </li>
              <li>Provide information about each of your children you are seeking instruction for</li>
              <li>Enroll your children in classes</li>
              <li>Browse available courses and sections (instances of courses)</li>
              <li>See how many students are interested in each course</li>
              <li>See the history of your children’s attendance in course sections</li>
              <li>Propose courses</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Soon you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Propose course sections to help form groups</li>
          </ul>
