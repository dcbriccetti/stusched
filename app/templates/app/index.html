          <p>One of the challenges in teaching programming to kids is organizing the kids into
              groups by ability, interest, budget, and availability. I am developing this system to help.
              With it you can:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Register yourself as the parent or guardian of one or more students interested in learning computer
                  programming from <a href="http://davebsoft.com">Dave Briccetti</a>
              </li>
              <li>Provide information about each of your children you are seeking instruction for</li>
              <li>Browse available courses and sections (instances of courses)</li>
              <li>See the history of your childrenâ€™s attendance in course sections</li>
              <li>Propose courses</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Soon you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Propose course sections to help form groups</li>
              <li>Enroll in course sections</li>
          </ul>
