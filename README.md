StuSched will be a mini
student information system (SIS) written in
Django. It is being written to solve the problem
of when to schedule course sections so that interested
students can attend at those times.

StuSched will allow teachers to
propose course sections at various times,
and parents of students
can register interest in specific proposed sections
at the times when their child can attend. 
StuSched can alert the teacher when there is
enough interest to schedule a class section.
